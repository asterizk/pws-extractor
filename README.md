# SwiftBar PWS Precipitation Plugin

![Screenshot of SwiftBar PWS Precipitation Plugin in action](docs/menubar.png)

A SwiftBar-compatible plugin that displays current precipitation data from your Weather Underground Personal Weather Station (PWS) in your macOS menu bar. This version uses **only the Python standard library** â€” no dependencies or virtual environment required.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asterizk/swiftbar-pws-precip.git
   cd swiftbar-pws-precip
   ```

2. Copy the example configuration file and fill in your API key and station ID:
   ```bash
   cp weather.conf.example weather.conf
   ```

   Then edit `weather.conf`:
   ```ini
   [weather]
   api_key = your_api_key_here
   station_id = your_station_id_here
   ```

3. Run the script manually to test:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## Using as a SwiftBar Plugin

To install the plugin into your SwiftBar plugin directory:

```bash
make install
```

To uninstall it later:

```bash
make uninstall
```

After installation, the plugin should appear in your macOS menu bar if SwiftBar is running.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (included by default on macOS)
- SwiftBar: https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar
- No virtual environment or Python packages needed

## Notes

- `weather.conf` contains sensitive configuration like your API key and is ignored via `.gitignore`.
- `weather.conf.example` is a safe placeholder for others to copy and customize.
- The plugin script prints total daily accumulation in the menu bar and current precipitation rate in the dropdown.
